# Hi there 👋, welcome to the profile 
### feel a refreshing experience through a tour of my profile .


## *About Me*

I happen to posses the skillset of a full stack developer with my primary  aim in Data Science and Machine Learning .

I stumbled across python few years ago and since then I have fallen in love with the language and programming itself. From simple if else statements to advanced concepts of oops , from simple programs of python to making advanced projects in python like NASA-ISI notifier , I have thoroughly enjoyed programming and I am proud of it . 

I also have the required knowledge of frontend like html,css and have worked with various frameworks like Bootstrap(see my tindog project) for creating responsive webpages and **flask** which is the web framework in python . All this knowledge has helped me in creating some simple , some complex **machine learning models** and displaying them over the web pages . 

My machine learning knowlege consists of both supervised and unsupersvised machine learning , from using simple **linear regression** to using **Ensembling techniques** consisting of **bagging,boosting and stacking** , using XGboost in some models while making clusters using k-means with some other models, i have a good knowledge
of machine learning projects , I can say that i am ready to work in any given domain , thinking of new Ideas to solve problems with ML.

I have woked closed with 100 + apis used to get or post data according to the program requirements of which my favorite is using **GPT-3** for workout tracking , Thanks to **OPEN AI** for giving their api access to everyone in this planet .
